# Jacks-Trivia
A local trivia game where you can create trivia questions, grouped into categories, and then take a randomized quiz. 

This was made during my Freshmen year at Drexel, so im uploading it as an archive and because I am slightly proud of it. Its simple, but its finished and it works for its purpose.

## Intresting Features to add
I may add more question types, such as filling in the blank, true or false, etc.

## Bugs
None reported so far
